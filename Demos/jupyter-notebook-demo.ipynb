    "- Explain what a Jupyter Notebook is and its relevance in the context of interactive computing and data science.\n",
    "- Recognize the history and development of the Jupyter Notebook from IPython to the introduction of the Project Jupyter.\n",
    "- Utilize Markdown to format text, create lists, headers, links, images, and tables within a Jupyter Notebook to enhance readability and presentation of the content.\n",
    "- Differentiate between Markdown cells for text formatting and code cells for executing Python code in a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "- Execute Python code directly within a Jupyter Notebook, observing the output inline with the code which enhances debugging and learning.\n",

    "IPython, a predecessor of Jupyter, started in 2004. In 2011, the first version of Notebooks for **IPython** was released, and in 2014, a spin-off project called Project Jupyter was inroduced. The name Jupyter is an indirect acronym of the three core languages it was designed for: [JUlia](https://julialang.org/), [PYThon](https://www.python.org/), and [R](https://www.r-project.org/)."
