    "- Create scatter plots using Plotly Express to analyze relationships between two variables.\n",
    "- Utilize filtering to clean data and prepare it for visualization.\n",
    "- Customize scatter plot aesthetics by updating axis titles and employing method chaining to streamline code.\n",
    "- Interpret trends in data by incorporating trend lines using ordinary least squares (OLS) methods.\n",
    "- Apply color-coding to scatter plots to differentiate data points by categories such as season or age, enhancing the analysis.\n",
    "- Adjust the size of data points in scatter plots based on quantitative variables to reflect the magnitude of data points visually.\n",
    "- Analyze the relationship between various basketball statistics, such as assists and points per game, to understand player performance dynamics.\n",
    "- Develop a comprehensive understanding of data visualization techniques that allow for effective communication of complex data insights."
