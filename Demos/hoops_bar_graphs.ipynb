    "- Utilize the Plotly Express library in Python to create bar graphs by importing and aliasing the library as demonstrated in the lesson.\n",
    "- Load and filter data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, ensuring that only relevant data (up to the '2022-23' season for Pascal Siakam's data) is included.\n",
    "- Create basic vertical bar graphs to represent data visually, focusing on specific basketball statistics like field goals made (FGM) and field goal attempts (FGA).\n",
    "- Modify graph aesthetics by renaming axis titles to enhance readability and presentation quality.\n",
    "- Interpret changes over time in basketball performance statistics by analyzing bar charts that display different statistical categories like field goal percentages."
