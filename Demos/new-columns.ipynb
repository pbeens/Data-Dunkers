    "By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n",
    "- Understand the process of adding new columns to a DataFrame in Python using Pandas, to enhance data with calculated metrics.\n",
    "- Calculate averages and other derived statistics, such as shot averages from field goal and free throw percentages, and add these as new columns to a DataFrame.\n",
    "- Apply mathematical operations to DataFrame columns to create meaningful new data points, such as total minutes played across all games.\n",
    "- Use rounding functions to format numerical data in DataFrames, ensuring clarity and precision in data presentation.\n",
    "- Manipulate DataFrames to display specific columns and limit the output to a subset of records, such as the top 10 players by a particular metric.\n",
    "- Develop proficiency in using Python for data manipulation, enhancing their ability to prepare data for analysis or reporting."
