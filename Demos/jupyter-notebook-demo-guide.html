<h2 id="chapter-1-introduction-to-jupyter-notebooks">Chapter 1: Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-a-jupyter-notebook">What is a Jupyter Notebook?</h3>
<p>Jupyter Notebooks are web applications that allow users to create and share documents with live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. These features make Jupyter Notebooks an invaluable tool for data analysis, scientific research, and educational purposes, blending code and content in a versatile, interactive environment. Central to their functionality are two primary types of cells: markdown cells, which enable the inclusion of formatted text, and code cells, which can execute programming code. The markdown cells allow for comprehensive documentation alongside the code, facilitating clear, annotated explanations of the coding process, while the code cells support the execution of that code within the same document, making Jupyter Notebooks an ideal platform for interactive, reproducible research and learning.</p>
<h3 id="the-evolution-of-jupyter-notebooks">The Evolution of Jupyter Notebooks</h3>
<p>The concept of Jupyter Notebooks originated from IPython, a project started in 2004 to enhance interactive computing in Python. In 2011, the first version of Notebooks was released within IPython, marking a significant step towards interactive and exploratory computing. By 2014, the project evolved into what is known today as Project Jupyter. This transition reflected the project's expansion to support additional programming languages, notably Julia and R, alongside Python. The name &quot;Jupyter&quot; itself is a nod to these three core languages, forming an indirect acronym that encapsulates the project's multi-language support.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started-with-jupyter-notebooks">Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks</h3>
<p>Jupyter Notebooks can be accessed and used through various platforms, including Callysto and Colab, offering a flexible environment for users to perform computational tasks. These platforms provide an entry point for a wide range of activities, from simple coding exercises to complex data analysis projects, all within the convenient framework of a web browser.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-basics-of-markdown-in-jupyter-notebooks">Chapter 2: Basics of Markdown in Jupyter Notebooks</h2>
<h3 id="introduction-to-markdown">Introduction to Markdown</h3>
<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to format text easily. In Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown allows users to create formatted text using simple symbols to represent different styles, such as bold, italics, or strikethrough. This feature enables the creation of easily readable documents that can include both explanatory text and code.</p>
<h3 id="formatting-text">Formatting Text</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bold, Italics, and Strikethrough</strong>: By enclosing text in specific symbols (<code>**bold**</code>, <code>*italics*</code>, <code>~~strikethrough~~</code>), users can emphasize different parts of their narrative text.</li>
<li><strong>Monospaced Font</strong>: Using backticks (`text`), you can represent code or commands within a narrative text, making it clear what is meant to be typed or executed.</li>
<li><strong>Indentation</strong>: Markdown also supports text indentation using the <code>&gt;</code> symbol, useful for quoting text or creating visually distinct sections.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="editing-and-formatting-cells">Editing and Formatting Cells</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-Click to Edit</strong>: Any Markdown cell can be edited by simply double-clicking on it, allowing for quick corrections or updates to the notebook's content.</li>
<li><strong>Headers for Structuring</strong>: Markdown supports six levels of headers, enabling the organization of content into well-defined sections, similar to the structure of a book or a report.</li>
<li><strong>Lists and Bullet Points</strong>: Unordered (<code>-</code> or <code>*</code>) and ordered (<code>1.</code>, <code>2.</code>, etc.) lists are essential for presenting information in a clear, concise manner.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="inserting-links-and-images">Inserting Links and Images</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hyperlinks</strong>: To embed links, Markdown uses a simple syntax: <code>[Displayed Text](URL)</code>. This allows users to include external resources seamlessly within their text.</li>
<li><strong>Images</strong>: Similarly, images can be inserted using <code>![Alt text](URL)</code>, enriching the notebook with visual content that can explain or complement the text.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="creating-tables-in-markdown">Creating Tables in Markdown</h3>
<p>Markdown supports the creation of tables, combining pipes (<code>|</code>) and dashes (<code>-</code>) to visually organize data within a notebook. This feature allows for the presentation of structured data directly alongside narrative text and code, enhancing the document's clarity and utility.</p>
<p>The syntax for crafting tables in Markdown is designed for simplicity and flexibility, offering customization options to accommodate various data presentation needs.</p>
<h4 id="basic-table-structure">Basic Table Structure</h4>
<p>To assemble a basic table, delineate columns with pipes and use dashes to separate the header row from the body. This arrangement allows for quick construction and easy readability of tabular data.</p>
<p>Example syntax for a simple table:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">| Column 1 Header | Column 2 Header |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Row 1 Cell 1    | Row 1 Cell 2    |
| Row 2 Cell 1    | Row 2 Cell 2    |
</code></pre>
<p>This Markdown code results in a table with two columns and two rows, including the header row. The pipes (<code>|</code>) define the columns, and dashes (<code>-</code>) are used to separate the header from the body of the table.</p>
<h4 id="alignment">Alignment</h4>
<p>You can align text in the columns to the left, right, or center by including colons (<code>:</code>) in the header row separation line. Here's how you can specify different alignments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left-aligned (default): <code>|:------------|</code> or simply <code>|------------|</code></li>
<li>Center-aligned: <code>|:-----------:|</code></li>
<li>Right-aligned: <code>|-----------:|</code></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="example-of-an-aligned-table">Example of an Aligned Table</h4>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">| Left Aligned  | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |
|:--------------|:---------------:|--------------:|
| Text          | Text            | Text          |
| More text     | More text       | More text     |
</code></pre>
<p>This Markdown code creates a table with three columns, each demonstrating a different text alignment.</p>
<h4 id="advanced-table-formatting">Advanced Table Formatting</h4>
<p>While Markdown in Jupyter Notebooks supports basic table structures, some advanced formatting options might require HTML for more complex layouts, such as cell merging or multi-line text within a cell. However, for most purposes, the Markdown approach offers a quick and clean way to display data neatly.</p>
<h4 id="practical-usage">Practical Usage</h4>
<p>Creating tables in Markdown is especially useful for presenting results, comparing figures, and organizing data points in a way that's immediately understandable. It enhances the readability of your notebooks by structuring information in a compact and visually appealing format.</p>
<p><em>By mastering table creation in Markdown, you'll be able to enrich your Jupyter Notebooks, making them not only more informative but also engaging for your audience, whether they're colleagues, students, or the general public interested in your work.</em></p>
<h2 id="chapter-3-advanced-markdown-formatting">Chapter 3: Advanced Markdown Formatting</h2>
<h3 id="advanced-text-formatting">Advanced Text Formatting</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blockquotes</strong>: Use the <code>&gt;</code> symbol for block quotes to set text apart from the main body, useful for highlighting quotations or important notes.</li>
<li><strong>Horizontal Rules</strong>: Create a thematic break in your text with horizontal rules using three or more hyphens <code>---</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="enhanced-lists">Enhanced Lists</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nested Lists</strong>: Demonstrate how to create nested lists by indenting list items, allowing for the organization of information in a hierarchical structure.</li>
<li><strong>Task Lists</strong>: Introduction to task lists using <code>- [ ]</code> for incomplete tasks and <code>- [x]</code> for completed tasks, ideal for to-do lists or tracking progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="code-blocks-and-syntax-highlighting">Code Blocks and Syntax Highlighting</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fenced Code Blocks</strong>: Use triple backticks ``` to create fenced code blocks for larger snippets of code or to enable syntax highlighting by specifying the programming language.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="extended-features">Extended Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Footnotes</strong>: Explain how to create footnotes in Markdown, which are useful for providing additional information or citations without cluttering the main text.</li>
<li><strong>Tables with Advanced Formatting</strong>: Expand on the basic table syntax to include row and column spans (though this may require HTML in some Markdown flavors), alignment, and formatting within cells.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This chapter aims to provide readers with the knowledge to employ Markdown's advanced features effectively, enhancing the presentation and functionality of their Jupyter Notebooks. By utilizing these advanced formatting tools, users can create more engaging and informative notebooks that better serve their purposes, whether for data analysis, educational content, or documentation.</em></p>

<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#x27;Hello World!&#x27;</span>)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Variables and String Manipulation</strong>: Assigning strings to variables and then printing them showcases basic variable usage and string manipulation.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="hljs-comment"># Assign the string &#x27;Peter&#x27; to the variable name</span>
name = <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;Peter&#x27;</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># Print &#x27;Hello&#x27; followed by the value of the variable name</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#x27;Hello&#x27;</span>, name)
</code></pre>
<p><em>These examples illustrate the execution of Python code within Jupyter Notebooks, highlighting the seamless transition between writing code, executing it, and viewing the output all within the same document.</em></p>
<h3 id="practical-application-plotting-with-plotly-express">Practical Application: Plotting with Plotly Express</h3>
<p>An example of a more complex application involves creating a plot with Plotly Express, a high-level plotting library. Here's how to plot (n) on the x-axis and (n^2) on the y-axis using Plotly Express:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> plotly.express <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> px

<span class="hljs-comment"># Data for plotting</span>
n = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>]
n_squared = [i**<span class="hljs-number">2</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> i <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> n]

<span class="hljs-comment"># Create the plot</span>
fig = px.line(x=n, y=n_squared, title=<span class="hljs-string">&#x27;Plot of n vs. n^2&#x27;</span>)

<span class="hljs-comment"># Show the plot</span>
fig.show()
</code></pre>
