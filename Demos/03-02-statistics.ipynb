    "Statistics are used in many fields of study to investigate why things happen, when they occur, and whether their reoccurrence is predictable. Some everyday examples of how statistics are used includeÂ¹:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Biology**: Statistics can be used to analyze data from experiments and research studies in biology.\n",
    "- **Business growth**: Statistics can be used to analyze sales data and other business metrics to identify trends and opportunities for growth.\n",
    "- **Economics**: Statistics can be used to analyze economic data such as GDP, inflation rates, and unemployment rates.\n",
    "- **Farming & gardening**: Statistics can be used to analyze crop yields and other agricultural data.\n",
    "- **Groceries**: Statistics can be used to analyze sales data for grocery stores and other retailers.\n",
    "- **Housing**: Statistics can be used to analyze housing data such as home prices and rental rates.\n",
    "- **Infrastructure**: Statistics can be used to analyze data related to infrastructure such as traffic patterns and road conditions.\n",
    "- **Medicine**: Statistics can be used to analyze medical data such as patient outcomes and drug efficacy.\n",
    "- **Warranties**: Statistics can be used to analyze warranty claims data to identify trends and potential issues with products.\n",
    "- **Website performance**: Statistics can be used to analyze website traffic data and user behavior.\n",
