    "By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n",
    "- Understand the functionality and usage of the Pandas `drop()` method to remove unwanted rows from a DataFrame, and learn to make changes permanent by re-assigning the modified DataFrame.\n",
    "- Utilize the `sort_values()` method in Pandas to order data within a DataFrame based on one or more columns, and adjust sorting order using the `ascending` parameter.\n",
    "- Filter and reduce the number of columns in a DataFrame to focus on relevant data for analysis or visualization.\n",
    "- Demonstrate proficiency in handling and manipulating DataFrame columns and rows to prepare data for detailed analysis or reporting.\n",
    "- Develop skills in using Python for data manipulation and visualization, preparing them for advanced data handling tasks in real-world applications.\n",
    "- Apply these techniques to create structured and insightful visual presentations of data using libraries such as Plotly Express."
