Inputs can come from different sources such as a user typing on a keyboard, a file on the computer, or a sensor in a device. Inputs are the starting point for a program, providing the raw data that it needs to operate.\n","\n","**Process**: This stage involves the program taking the input data and performing operations on it according to the instructions written by the programmer. This can include calculations, data manipulation, decision making (using conditions and loops), and performing specific actions based on the input. The process stage is where the logic of the program is executed, transforming the input into something else.\n","\n","**Output**: The output is the result of the program's processing. It's the end product that is presented to the user or another system. Outputs can take many forms, such as displayed text on a screen, saved files, sounds, graphs, or even signals sent to control other devices. The output is what the program produces after it has completed its processing of the input.\n","\n","In programming, especially when following the IPO model, there's an often implicit but crucial stage before Input called **Setup**. During the Setup stage, you prepare your program for the tasks it needs to perform. This involves steps like importing necessary libraries, initializing variables, and setting up the environment your program will run in. Libraries are collections of pre-written code that you can use to add functionality to your program without having to write everything from scratch. For example, if your program needs to perform complex mathematical calculations, you might import a math library. Initializing variables might involve setting up counters or preparing lists to store data that will be processed. The Setup stage is essential because it lays the groundwork for your program to function correctly and efficiently, ensuring that all the tools and settings are in place before it starts processing inputs.\n","\n","Understanding the IPO model is crucial for programming because it helps in structuring how a program should work. It emphasizes the flow of data through the program, from the initial input to the final output, guiding programmers in planning and implementing their code efficiently.\n","\n","<sup>1</sup> With help from ChatGPT"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Setup"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["We always start any Python program by importing any libraries we might need.
