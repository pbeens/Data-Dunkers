    "By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n",
    "- Import data using the Pandas library and understand the steps involved in preparing data for analysis, including filtering data based on specific conditions.\n",
    "- Create pie charts using Plotly Express to visually represent data, learning how to set parameters like `values` for the segment sizes and `names` for the labels.\n",
    "- Utilize pie charts to analyze and display data distributions effectively, such as comparing contributions or proportions within a dataset.\n",
    "- Modify and customize data visualizations with titles and other attributes to enhance readability and presentation quality.\n",
    "- Apply data filtering techniques to exclude unwanted data from visualizations, such as national totals in a dataset focused on regional statistics.\n",
    "- Develop practical skills in data visualization with Python, enabling them to convey complex information succinctly and effectively through graphical representations."
