# Data Dunkers - Using Basketball Stats to Learn Data Science

*This repository has been extracted from my initial Data Analysis repository found [here](https://github.com/pbeens/Data-Analysis). If you are looking for previous content (such as presentations prior to December 2023), please visit that repository.*

# Where to Start - Workshop

If you are doing these activities as part of a workshop, you can use this [Google Slides presentation](https://bit.ly/dd-slides) as a starting point. Simply make a copy of the entire slideshow and then delete or modify slides as necessary.

# Colab vs Callysto

Many of the notebooks include links to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and [Callysto](https://hub.callysto.ca/). Your choice will depend on your specific situation. If your school district blocks or has not enabled Colab, Callysto should work for you.

When you open the notebook in Colab, it uploads *just that notebook*, allowing you to edit and/or run it there. Local links (such as back to the main page) will **not** work, so a link to the page in the repository will also be available for you. Always choose this if you are in Colab.

When you open the notebook in Callysto, it uploads the *entire repository*, allowing you to edit and/or run it there. Local links (such as back to the main page) will work. Links back to the repository will also work.
