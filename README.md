## Workshop Slides

If you are doing these activities as part of a workshop, you can use this [Google Slides presentation](https://bit.ly/dd-slides) as a starting point. Simply make a copy of the entire slideshow and then delete or modify slides as necessary.

## Lessons

See [this document](https://github.com/pbeens/Data-Dunkers/blob/main/Lessons.ipynb) for the list of suggested lessons.

## Colab vs Callysto

Many of the notebooks include links to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and [Callysto](https://hub.callysto.ca/). Your choice will depend on your specific situation. If your school district blocks or has not enabled Colab, Callysto should work for you. 

## Cheatsheet

We're including a comprehensive [cheatsheet](https://github.com/pbeens/Data-Dunkers/blob/main/cheatsheet.md) of code snippets that you may find valuable in helping you write your programs.
