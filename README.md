# Data Dunkers - Using Basketball Stats to Learn Data Science

*This repository has been extracted from my initial Data Analysis repository found [here](https://github.com/pbeens/Data-Analysis). If you are looking for previous content (such as presentations prior to December 2023), please visit that repository.*

# Credit

Many of the resources found or mentioned here are built upon the tutorials found at [github.com/callysto/basketball-and-data-science](https://github.com/callysto/basketball-and-data-science), used with permission.

# Workshop Slides

If you are doing these activities as part of a workshop, you can use this [Google Slides presentation](https://bit.ly/dd-slides) as a starting point. Simply make a copy of the entire slideshow and then delete or modify slides as necessary.

# Colab vs Callysto

Many of the notebooks include links to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and [Callysto](https://hub.callysto.ca/). Your choice will depend on your specific situation. If your school district blocks or has not enabled Colab, Callysto should work for you.

## Important!

When you open the notebook in *Colab*, it uploads *just that notebook*, allowing you to edit and/or run it there. Local links (such as back to the main page) will **not** work, so a link to the page in the repository will also be available for you. Always choose this if you are in Colab.

When you open the notebook in *Callysto*, it uploads the *entire repository*, allowing you to edit and/or run it there. Local links (such as back to the main page) will work. Links back to the repository will also work. 

# Lesson Suggestions

The lessons have been designed to be done in this order, but you may wish to adapt the order, depending on your needs or time limits.
