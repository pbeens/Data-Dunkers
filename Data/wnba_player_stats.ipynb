    "Program: WNBA Player Stats Scraper\n",
    "Author: Peter Beens\n",
    "Date: 2024-05-19\n",
    "Description: This program scrapes WNBA player statistics from ESPN's website using Selenium and Pandas.\n",
    "             It initializes a WebDriver, navigates to the stats page, and allows the user to manually\n",
    "             interact with the page to load additional data. The program then extracts player names and\n",
    "             their statistics, merges the data into a single DataFrame, and saves it to a CSV file.\n",
    "Usage: Run the script in an environment with Selenium, Pandas, and a WebDriver installed. Ensure geckodriver\n",
    "       is installed and in your PATH for Firefox.\n",
    "Dependencies: \n",
    "    - selenium\n",
    "    - pandas\n",
    "    - time\n",
    "Notes: \n",
    "    - Ensure you have the necessary WebDriver installed (geckodriver for Firefox).\n",
